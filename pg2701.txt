The Vancouver campus offers more than two dozen academic divisions, while the Okanagan campus has eight. The academic calendars for both campuses include two-term winter and summer sessions, although the summer session is optional. The primary language of instruction at UBC is English. First-year international students can opt to enroll in the Vantage One program at UBC's Vantage College, which aims to help students improve their English, in part by stretching their first year of study from eight to 11 months. Following completion, students transition into the second year of their UBC degree program. Examples of UBC research facilities include Canadaâ€™s national TRIUMF subatomic physics laboratory, the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm and the Institute for Healthy Living and Chronic Disease Prevention.
